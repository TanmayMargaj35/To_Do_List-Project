📝 To-Do List Web App  
Personal Project

📌 Overview  
This is a personal web development project where I built a responsive and interactive **To-Do List App** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The app allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks with a clean interface and real-time interactivity.

🎯 Objectives  
- Build a simple and functional to-do app for daily task tracking  
- Learn and apply core web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling  
- Focus on clean UI/UX for better usability

🧠 Features  
- Add new tasks with a single click  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Remove tasks from the list  
- Responsive and intuitive user interface  
- Real-time interaction without page reload

🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git & GitHub

🚀 How It Works  
1. User types a task into the input box  
2. Clicking the **Add** button appends it to the task list  
3. Clicking a task toggles its completed state  
4. Tasks can be removed (if implemented in the script)  
5. All changes reflect instantly on the UI
